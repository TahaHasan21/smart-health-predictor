#  Smart Health Predictor – Spring Boot Microservices + ML

Smart Health Predictor is a full-stack microservices-based healthcare application that allows users to enter symptoms, receive AI-driven disease predictions, and book doctor appointments — all routed through a scalable, secure API gateway.

> 🔬 ML meets scalable microservices — enabling intelligent diagnosis and seamless healthcare access.

##  Microservices Breakdown

| Service          | Responsibility                         |
|------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `user-service`   | Handles users, roles, notifications       |
| `doctor-service` | Manages doctor info and availability      |
| `appointment-service` | Booking logic, triggers ML prediction |
| `ml-predictor-service` | Flask ML API that returns predictions |
| `api-gateway`    | Entry point, routes requests to services  |
| `discovery-server` | Eureka registry for service lookup      |

## ⚙️ How to Run This Project Locally

> Ensure you have **Java 17**, **Maven**, **Python 3**, and **PostgreSQL** installed.

###  1. Set up PostgreSQL

- Create DBs: `user_db`, `doctor_db`, `appointment_db`
- Set your DB username/password in each service's `application.properties`

###  2. Run the ML Predictor (Flask)

```bash
cd symptom-ml-flask
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

✅ Flask will run on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

###  3. Start Spring Boot Services

Start the services in this order (all ports are customizable):

-  `discovery-server` → `http://localhost:8761`
-  `api-gateway` → `http://localhost:8080`
-  `user-service` → `http://localhost:8081`
-  `doctor-service` → `http://localhost:8082`
-  `appointment-service` → `http://localhost:8083`
-  `ml-predictor-service` → `http://localhost:8084`

 📍 All registered services can be viewed at: 👉 [http://localhost:8761](http://localhost:8761)
